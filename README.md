# wordpress-likes-and-replies

Add IndieWeb likes and replies to posts with microformat2 markup using the value from custom fields

Usage: Ideal for posting from outside of WordPress, e.g. from Workflow on iOS. Add the required page URL to a custom filed called 'Liked' or 'Reply' to have it automatically added to the post body. Microformat2 markup ensures the relevant webmention is sent on posting.
